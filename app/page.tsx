          My name is <strong>Reinhart Barus</strong>, a 12th-grade student at
          a private high school in Bandung. I’ve had a strong interest
          in technology since I was a child. 🔍
        </p>

        <p>
          ⚡ That interest began with curiosity about electricity and eventually
          grew into a passion for the digital world, especially after I started
          learning <code>HTML</code> in junior high school. 💻
        </p>

        <p>
          🚀 Currently, I’m focusing on frontend development using{" "}
          <strong>React.js</strong> and continuously exploring other web
          technologies. 🌐
        </p>

        <p>
          🎓 After graduation, I plan to pursue a degree in a technology-related
          field such as <strong>Informatics Engineering</strong> or{" "}
          <strong>Computer Science</strong>. 🎯
