                My name is <strong>Reinhart Barus</strong>, a 12th-grade student
                at a private high school in Bandung. I've had a strong interest
                in technology since I was a child.

                That interest began with curiosity about electricity and
                eventually grew into a passion for the digital world, especially
                after I started learning <code>HTML</code> in junior high
                school.

                Currently, I'm focusing on frontend development using{" "}
